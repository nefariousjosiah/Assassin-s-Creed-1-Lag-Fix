Hello,

If you are wondering why this issue is called, it's because Assassin's creed is trying to connect to a Ubisoft server that is not currently active while playing AC1.

To fix this you would need to change the IP it's reaching out to (203.132.26.155) to the local host in the host file, this is what the bat file does.

This only works in Windows computers.

Make sure to run the script in administrative permissions
